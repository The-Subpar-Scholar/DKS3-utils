# ParamPatcher
This is header file for C++, it requires my other header file Process.h to function properly. This header file allows for the editing of params in DarkSoulsIII. Available are all innate functions or a variation thereof of igromanru's param patcher version 2.05. BaseParamClass has NOT been included yet, but will soon be included.
